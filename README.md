# Person-Reid #

Research projects of person re-identification


## Definition ##

The purpose of person re-identification is to recognize a unique pedestrian
among different camera views.

The pedestrian should have little discrepancy in appearance, and the cameras
should be still.

A typical input is two sets of pedestrians images sequences, namely *gallery*
and *probe*. The output should be a distance matrix. *Cumulative Match
Characteristic (CMC)* curve is used for evaluation.
